# Image Denoising
The aim is to improve the quality of binary images by removing noise and analysing its characterisitics

Here we solve this problem using Message Passing which can be viewed in further detail [here]https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04107

### Initial Setup
You can download the notebook along with the image or use your own (images should ideally be black/white, 1-bit, and 130x130 for best/efficent results)
